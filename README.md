# SQL Project: Medicare Outpatient Payments Analysis (2015)

## Overview
This project analyzes the **2015 CMS Medicare Outpatient Charges dataset** using **SQL (BigQuery)** and **Power BI**.  
The goal is to:
- Explore outpatient service utilization patterns
- Compare provider payments across states
- Estimate proxy Medicare payments (assuming 80% Medicare / 20% out-of-pocket split)
- Evaluate the relative economic footprint of hospital spending versus state total income

---

## Data

- **CMS Medicare Public Data**  
  - Table: `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2015`  
- **U.S. Census Bureau ACS (2015)**  
  - Table: `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_acs.state_2015_1yr`  

**Note:**
`average_total_payments` includes Medicare payments **plus** patient cost-sharing (deductible/copay).  
To approximate Medicare-only payments, a **0.8 multiplier (80%)** is applied as a proxy assumption.

**Note:**
The Census ACS dataset uses `geo_id` values, which are state-level FIPS codes.  
For this project, the two-digit FIPS codes were mapped to standard two-letter state abbreviations (e.g., `01` â†’ `AL`, `06` â†’ `CA`).  
This step ensured consistency when joining the ACS dataset with the Medicare outpatient spending data by state.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Previewed table schema and row counts  

2. **Top Outpatient Services (APC codes)**  
   - Identified top 10 services by claim volume  
   - Calculated weighted average payment per claim

**Note:**  
APC stands for *Ambulatory Payment Classification*, the system Medicare uses to group and reimburse outpatient hospital services. Each APC corresponds to a category of services with similar clinical and cost characteristics.

3. **State-Level Proxy Medicare Spending**  
   - Computed weighted averages and proxy Medicare payments  

4. **Spending vs Total Income**  
   - Estimated total personal income = population Ã— income per capita  
   - Compared proxy Medicare spending as % of total income

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

| State       | Proxy Payments-to-Income Ratio | Notes |
|-------------|--------------------------------|-------|
| **Maine (ME)**  | **0.22%** | Highest ratio â†’ reflects older population & higher Medicare dependence |
| **Alaska (AK)** | **0.02%** | Lowest ratio â†’ high average income, unique healthcare system |

- States with higher ratios â†’ **greater economic burden of outpatient care**  
- States with lower ratios â†’ **smaller relative footprint**, but may face **accessibility challenges**  
- Large states by population (e.g., California, Texas, New York) contribute the **highest total dollar spending**, but their ratios are lower due to bigger economic bases.  
- Smaller or rural states can show a **disproportionately high ratio**, even if their absolute spending is modest.  
- The ratio metric highlights not just spending, but the **relative strain of healthcare costs** on a stateâ€™s economy.

## Limitations

- **Incomplete State Coverage**  
  - Certain states (e.g., Maryland) are excluded from the dataset.  
  - Maryland is unique in operating under an **all-payer hospital rate-setting system**, where hospital reimbursement rates are regulated at the state level.  
  - Because of this structure, Maryland data is not included in the CMS Medicare Outpatient Charges dataset, and the analysis does not represent 100% of U.S. states.  

- **Proxy Calculation**  
  - The `average_total_payments` column includes not only Medicare reimbursements but also **copayments** and **deductibles**.  
  - This project assumes patient responsibility accounts for ~20%, and applies a proxy factor (0.8) to approximate Medicare-only spending. Actual values may differ.  

- **Time Scope**  
  - The dataset reflects **2015 data**. Demographics, cost structures, and Medicare reimbursement policies may have shifted significantly since then.  
  - For current relevance, the analysis should be replicated with more recent datasets.  

- **GDP Proxy**  
  - State-level economic comparison uses **population Ã— income per capita** as a proxy for GDP.  
  - While this provides a rough benchmark, it is not equivalent to official GDP figures from the BEA (Bureau of Economic Analysis).  
  - Insights should be interpreted as **relative approximations** rather than precise economic ratios.
