# SQL Project: Medicare Outpatient Payments Analysis (2015)

## Overview
This project analyzes the **2015 CMS Medicare Outpatient Charges dataset** using **SQL (BigQuery)**.  
The goal is to:
- Explore outpatient service utilization patterns
- Compare provider payments across states
- Estimate proxy Medicare payments (assuming 80% Medicare / 20% out-of-pocket split)
- Evaluate the relative economic footprint of hospital spending versus state total income

---

## Data

- **CMS Medicare Public Data**  
  - Table: `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2015`  
- **U.S. Census Bureau ACS (2015)**  
  - Table: `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_acs.state_2015_1yr`  

Note: `average_total_payments` includes Medicare payments **plus** patient cost-sharing (deductible/copay).  
To approximate Medicare-only payments, a **0.8 multiplier (80%)** is applied as a proxy assumption.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Previewed table schema and row counts  

2. **Top Outpatient Services (APC codes)**  
   - Identified top 10 services by claim volume  
   - Calculated weighted average payment per claim  

3. **State-Level Proxy Medicare Spending**  
   - Computed weighted averages and proxy Medicare payments  

4. **Spending vs Total Income**  
   - Estimated total personal income = population Ã— income per capita  
   - Compared proxy Medicare spending as % of total income

## Example Queries

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
```sql
SELECT *
FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2015`
LIMIT 10;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows
FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2015`;
```

### 2. Top 10 Services by Total Revenue
```sql
SELECT
  apc,
  SUM(outpatient_services) AS num_claims,
  ROUND(
    SAFE_DIVIDE(
      SUM(outpatient_services * average_total_payments),
      NULLIF(SUM(outpatient_services), 0)
    ), 2
  ) AS avg_payment_per_claim,
  ROUND(
    SUM(outpatient_services * average_total_payments), 2
  ) AS total_outpatient_payments
FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2015`
GROUP BY apc
ORDER BY num_claims DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 3. Proxy Medicare Payments by State
```sql
WITH state_pay AS (
  SELECT
    provider_state,
    SUM(outpatient_services) AS claims,
    SUM(outpatient_services * average_total_payments) AS total_outpatient_payments
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.cms_medicare.outpatient_charges_2015`
  GROUP BY provider_state
)
SELECT
  provider_state,
  ROUND(
    SAFE_DIVIDE(total_outpatient_payments, NULLIF(claims, 0)), 2
  ) AS avg_total_payment_per_claim,
  ROUND(total_outpatient_payments * 0.80, 2) AS proxy_medicare_payments
FROM state_pay
ORDER BY proxy_medicare_payments DESC;
```

### 4. Proxy Medicare Spending vs Total Income

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

| State       | Proxy Payments-to-Income Ratio | Notes |
|-------------|--------------------------------|-------|
| **Maine (ME)**  | **0.22%** | Highest ratio â†’ reflects older population & higher Medicare dependence |
| **Alaska (AK)** | **0.02%** | Lowest ratio â†’ high average income, unique healthcare system |

- States with higher ratios â†’ **greater economic burden of outpatient care**  
- States with lower ratios â†’ **smaller relative footprint**, but may face **accessibility challenges**  
- Large states by population (e.g., California, Texas, New York) contribute the **highest total dollar spending**, but their ratios are lower due to bigger economic bases.  
- Smaller or rural states can show a **disproportionately high ratio**, even if their absolute spending is modest.  
- The ratio metric highlights not just spending, but the **relative strain of healthcare costs** on a stateâ€™s economy.
